ARM Valuation

Overview

This project contains Python code and supporting materials for valuing Arm Holdings plc using:

Intrinsic valuation: DCF projections with explicit R&D capitalization and amortization.

Monte Carlo simulation: Revenue modeled as a geometric Brownian motion (drift & volatility).

Relative valuation: Regression-based P/S and EV/S multiples with peer group analysis and heteroscedasticity-robust inference.

Beta estimation: OLS regressions of "drift" and "volatility" drivers on peer returns.

All analyses use a convergence rate of  (the “distance formula” from Damodaran’s Advanced Valuation Certificate, Spring 2025).
